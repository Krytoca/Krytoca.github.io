            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Animals as Leaders was formed by Tosin Abasi and contained him as well as the former 3 members. The band was formed after Tosin's previous band, a metalcore band by the name of Reflux, was disbanded. At first Tosin was asked to do a seolo album for the heavy metal record label Prosthetic Records. He declines as he thought it was too egotistical. After a year of studying music he took the label's offer and created Animals as Leaders, the name being inspred by a Daniel Quinn novel known as Ishmael. By 2008 all the initial band members would leave and 2009 saw Javier Reyes and Matt Garstka joining the band.</p>

            <h2>The Djent Scene</h2>
            <p>The specific name for the genre that Animals as Leaders plays is known as Djent. Djent is a form of progressive metal that focuses on onomatopoeic efffects such as high-gain, distortion, palm-muted, low-pitch sounds. The first band to popularize the technique is the Swedish band Meshuggah. Their guitarist Fredrik Thordendal was considered its originator and pioneer of the sound. A common visual feature is the use of seven-striong, eight-string, or nine-string guitars. An example would be Tosin Abasi using his preferred eigh-string guitar while touring or recording.</p>
